## Usage

Custom components for Qlik Sense 3.1+ are installed in exactly the same way as other extension types in Qlik Sense.

Follow these instructions:

* [Import your extensions in Qlik Sense Dektop](http://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/3.0/Subsystems/Extensions/Content/Howtos/deploy-extensions.htm)
* [Import your extensions in Qlik Sense](http://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/3.0/Subsystems/Extensions/Content/Howtos/deploy-extensions.htm)

As soon as you have made the custom component available on your system, you are ready to use it within the Widget editor.
